\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[sec:signin]{Sign In/Sign Up Page} : For user authentication.
    \item \hyperref[sec:profile]{User Profile Page} : Displays user details.
    \item \hyperref[sec:book]{Book Page} : Provides details about a specific book.
    \item \hyperref[sec:basket]{Basket Page} : Shows the user's selected books for purchase.
    \item \hyperref[sec:search]{Search Results Page} : Displays books based on the userâ€™s search query.
\end{itemize}

%For the main pages put a mockup and describe it in detail.

    \item \textbf{New Arrivals} : Displaying the latest books added to our stock.
